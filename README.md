# Bellybutton Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive dashboard built using D3.js and Plotly to visualize biological data from the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. It allows users to explore various metadata and charts related to different test subjects. The key features of the project include:

1. **Interactive Dropdown**: Users can select different test subjects (samples) from a dropdown list to view their associated data and visualizations.
   
2. **Metadata Panel**: Displays key demographic information about the selected test subject, such as age, ethnicity, and gender.
   
3. **Charts**:
   - **Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the sample.
   - **Bubble Chart**: Provides a detailed view of the bacterial species abundance in the selected sample.
   
4. **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is responsive, making it easy to view and interact with on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the dashboard and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (D3.js)**: For creating dynamic, data-driven visualizations, and manipulating the DOM.
- **Plotly.js**: For rendering the interactive bar and bubble charts.
- **JSON**: Data is loaded from a local JSON file containing information on test subjects and sample data.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser or use a local server (e.g., Live Server in VSCode).
   
2. Once the dashboard is loaded, use the dropdown menu to select a test subject (sample ID).

3. After selecting a sample, the page will display the metadata and render the interactive bar and bubble charts.

4. Explore the charts to learn more about the test subject's bacterial diversity.
